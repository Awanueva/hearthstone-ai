## Synopsis

This is a game bot for HearthStone.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

1. There's no HearthStone simulation engine written in C++.
2. AlphaGo is so strong, and it uses Monte Carlo tree search.
3. I don't know Monte Carlo tree search before, and I want to learn it.
4. So, I want to try it out for the card game - HearthStone.
5. This project is what I got.

## Installation

1. Install HearthStone on Windows.
2. Enable logging to HearthStone, so we can know what's the board looks like.
3. Open the C# project under 'ui' folder.
4. Run it.
